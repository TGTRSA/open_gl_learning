[X] you need to initialise the opengl with glfw for windowing
[X] you need a view port to tell opengl the size of the window since opengl itself doesnt use the window
[X] glClearColor() => set the color buffer 
[X] glClear() => the "call"/command to actually write the color 








Big conclusion:
	OpenGL works on a "define things then do stuff with them basis" like you're building the components of a car before you can put it together then drive it
